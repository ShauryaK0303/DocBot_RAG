One Piece
One Piece (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series
written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been
serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly
Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters
compiled in 108 tankōbon volumes as of March 2024.
The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and
his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the
Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as
the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the
Pirates.
The manga spawned a media franchise, having been
adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an
anime series by Toei Animation, which began
broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed
fourteen animated feature films, one original video
animation, and thirteen television specials. Several
companies have developed various types of
merchandising and media, such as a trading card game
and numerous video games. The manga series was
licensed for an English language release in North America
and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia
by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed
by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in
North America in 2004 before the license was dropped
and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, worldbuilding, art, characterization, and humor. It has received
many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and
readers as one of the best manga of all time. By December
2023, it had over 523.2 million copies in circulation in 61
countries and regions worldwide, making it the bestselling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic
series printed in book volume. Several volumes of the
manga have broken publishing records, including the
highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and
2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for "the
most copies published for the same comic book series by a
single author". It was the best-selling manga for eleven
consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only
manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3

Music of One Piece
The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other
races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size),
giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked
people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people
(known as "Minks"). The world is governed by an
intercontinental organization known as the World
Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The
Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that
protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals.
There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within
the World Government that are their secret police. While
pirates are major opponents against the Government, the ones
who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army
who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension of the
series pits the World Government and their forces against
The globe of the One Piece world
pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over
the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any
individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—
rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious
fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which
grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective
methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.

The world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3]
Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs
perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with
huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four
seas: North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four
seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the
seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as
they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill

before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line
itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New
World.[Jp 14]

Premise
The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil
Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D.
Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his
own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named
Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami,
a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but
chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry[Jp 16]—later replaced by the Thousand Sunny[Jp 17]
—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures,
others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer
doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright;
Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member
of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates,
bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists, soldiers of
the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in
pursuit of their dreams.

Production
Concept and creation
Eiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series Vicky the Viking,
which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies
influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in One
Piece; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate
Edward "Blackbeard" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama
and his series Dragon Ball, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by The Wizard of
Oz, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story
where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]
While working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing One Piece in 1996.[6] It started as
two one-shot stories entitled Romance Dawn[6]—which would later be used as the title for One Piece's first
chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear
later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Akamaru Jump, and
reprinted in 2002 in One Piece Red guidebook. The second was published in the 41st issue of Weekly
Shōnen Jump in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, Wanted![7] In an interview with
TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of One Piece, revealed that the manga was rejected by Weekly
Shōnen Jump three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the series.[8]

Development

When creating the Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he
does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[9]
The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in
which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters'
techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are
designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud.
For example, Zoro's signature move is Onigiri, which is written as demon cut but is pronounced the same
as rice ball in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these
kanji readings in the anime since they "might have cut down the laughs by about half".[10] Nevertheless,
Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators "made the anime pretty close to the
manga".[10]
Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be translated.[11] In many instances, the English version of
the One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For
instance, "saaa" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and "zaaa" (the sound of pouring rain) are both
translated as "fshhhhhhh".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to
create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13]
This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the
morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of
the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the
boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that
there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids
including them in One Piece since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested
in love stories.[15]

Conclusion
Oda revealed that he originally planned One Piece to last five years, and that he had already planned the
ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the
story too much to end it in that period of time.[16] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the
author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[17] In July 2018, on the occasion
of the twenty-first anniversary of One Piece, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot,[18]
while in January 2019, he said that One Piece is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the
100th volume.[19] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga will end between
2024 and 2025.[20] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning;
he is committed to seeing it through.[21] In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be willing
to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[5] In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the
year's 35th issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump that One Piece was "headed toward the upcoming final saga."[22]
On January 4, 2021, One Piece reached its thousandth chapter.[23][24][25] In June 2022, Oda announced
that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to
begin with the release of chapter 1054.[26]

Media
Manga

Written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece has been serialized by Shueisha in the shōnen manga
anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 22, 1997.[27][28] Shueisha has collected its chapters into
individual tankōbon volumes. The first volume was released on December 24, 1997.[29] By March 4, 2024,
a total of 108 volumes have been released.[30]
The first English translation of One Piece was released by Viz Media in November 2002, who published its

2003.[31][32][33] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010
to catch up with the serialization in Japan.[34] Following the discontinuation of the print Shonen Jump, Viz
began releasing One Piece chapterwise in its digital successor Weekly Shonen Jump on January 30,
2012.[35] Following the digital Weekly Shonen Jump's cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started
simultaneously publishing One Piece through its Shonen Jump service, and by Shueisha through Manga
Plus, in January 2019.[36][37]
In the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006,[38] until
Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume.[39][40] In Australia and New Zealand, the English
volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.[41] In Poland,
Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga,[42] Glénat in France,[43] Panini Comics in
Mexico,[44] LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina,[45][46] Planeta de Libros in Spain,[47] Edizioni
Star Comics in Italy,[48] and Sangatsu Manga in Finland.[49]
Spin-offs and crossovers
Oda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of One Piece and Toriyama's Dragon Ball.
Entitled Cross Epoch, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump
and the April 2011 issue of the English Shonen Jump.[50] Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro,
author of Toriko, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled Taste of the Devil Fruit (
!
!!,
[51]
Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!, lit. 'The True Food! Devil Fruit!!'),
which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of
Weekly Shōnen Jump. The spin-off series One Piece Party (
, Wan Pīsu Pātī),
written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the January 2015 issue of Saikyō
Jump.[52] Its final chapter was published on Shōnen Jump+ on February 2, 2021.[53]

Festival films and original video animation
One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack! was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super
Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi.[54] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster
that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl,
Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and
his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to
retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and
Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all
the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the
three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are
forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.

A second film, One Piece: Romance Dawn Story, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the
Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of Romance Dawn.[55][7]
It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the Thousand Sunny. In search for food
for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There
he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her
upbringing causes her to value the town as her "treasure". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture
him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk
saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the
treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship. The film was later released as a triple feature
DVD with Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!! and Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night,
that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.[56]
The One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0 original video animation adapts the manga's special "Chapter
0", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three
thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.[57]
1999 TV series
An anime television series adaptation produced by Toei Animation premiered on Fuji Television on October

anime series remake for Netflix, restarting from the East Blue story arc, to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the original anime series. The remake will be titled The One Piece.[60]
Theatrical films
Fourteen animated theatrical films based on the One Piece series have been released. The films are typically
released in March to coincide with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[61] The films feature selfcontained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality
than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other
anime films, and were thus usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in
both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed
the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house
dubs by the company.[62][63]

Live-action series
On July 21, 2017, Weekly Shōnen Jump editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow

part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[64][65] Eiichiro Oda served as executive producer for the
series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO Adelstein and Becky Clements.[65] The series would reportedly
begin with the East Blue arc.[66]

In January 2020, Oda revealed that Netflix ordered a first season consisting of ten episodes.[67] On May 19,
2020, producer Marty Adelstein revealed during an interview with SyFy Wire, that the series was originally
set to begin filming in Cape Town sometime around August, but has since been delayed to around
September due to COVID-19. He also revealed that, during the same interview, all ten scripts had been
written for the series and they were set to begin casting sometime in June.[68] However, executive producer
Matt Owens stated in September 2020 that casting had not yet commenced.[69] On September 15, 2023,
Oda revealed that the show has been renewed for the second season.[70]
In March 2021, production started up again with showrunner Steven Maeda revealing that the series
codename is Project Roger.[71] In November 2021, it was announced that the casting for the series includes
Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy, Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero
Gibson as Usopp and Taz Skylar as Sanji.[72][73] In March 2022, Netflix added Morgan Davies as Koby,
Ilia Isorelýs Paulino as Alvida, Aidan Scott as Helmeppo, Jeff Ward as Buggy, McKinley Belcher III as
Arlong, Vincent Regan as Garp and Peter Gadiot as Shanks to the cast in recurring roles.[74]

games, such as the titles of the Grand Battle! meta-series. The series debuted on July 19, 2000, with From
TV Animation – One Piece: Become the Pirate King!.[75] Over forty games have been produced based on
the franchise.[76] Additionally, One Piece characters and settings have appeared in various Shonen Jump
crossover games, such as Battle Stadium D.O.N, Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars, J-Stars Victory
VS and Jump Force.

A series of light novels was published based on the first festival film, certain episodes of the anime
television series, and all but the first feature film. They feature artwork by Oda and are written by Tatsuya
Hamasaki. The first of these novels, One Piece: Defeat The Pirate Ganzak! was released on June 3,
1999.[78] One Piece: Logue Town Chapter followed on July 17, 2000, as an adaptation of the anime

1 million copies.[157] Additionally, One Piece is the only work whose volumes have ranked first every year
in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.[158][159]

One Piece has also sold well in North America, charting on Publishers Weekly's list of best-selling comics
for April/May 2007 and numerous times on The New York Times Manga Best Seller list.[160][161][162] On
ICv2's list of Top 25 Manga Properties Fall 2008 for North America, which is compiled by interviews with
retailers and distributors, Nielsen BookScan's Top 20 Lists of graphic novels and ICv2's own analysis of
information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, One Piece came in fifteenth place.[163] It rose to
second place on their Top 25 Manga Properties Q3 2010 list.[164] By August 2022, the manga has sold 2.9
million copies in print in North America (including single volumes and omnibus editions).[165]
In France, One Piece has been the best-selling manga since 2011,[166] with over 31.80 million copies sold
by August 2022.[167] The manga is very popular in the country, where its sales alone represent 8.5% of the
French manga market by 2021.[168] The first volume had sold more than 1 million copies in France by July
2021.[169] The 100th volume had one of the biggest initial prints ever for a manga in the French market,
selling 131,270 copies in just three days, the best-selling manga volume in a week in the country.[170][171]
The manga sold 6,011,536 copies in 2021.[172] This amount represents almost 20% of the total sales in the
country; almost one in five volumes of the series was sold in the year.[173]
In Italy, One Piece had 18 million copies in circulation by April 2021.[174] which represents around 22.5%
of the series market outside Japan.[175] In September 2021, the limited edition of the ninety-eighth volume
ranked first in the best-selling books weekly ranking, making it the first time that a manga reaches that
achievement.[176]
In Germany, One Piece is the second best-selling manga behind Dragon Ball. The manga had sold 6.7
million copies in the country.[177]

Critical response
Allen Divers of Anime News Network comments in 2003 that the art style One Piece employs "initially
seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than
that from its Japanese origins", adding that the "artwork and settings come across as timeless in their
presentation". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball) shines through in Oda's
style of writing with its "huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor" and that, in One Piece, he
"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots".[178] Rebecca
Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to "blend action, humor, and heavy fare
together" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[179] The
website activeAnime describes the artwork in One Piece as "wonderfully quirky and full of
expression".[180] Mario Vuk from Splash Comics commented that Oda's "pleasantly bright and dynamic"
art style suits the story's "funny and exciting" atmosphere.[181] Isaiah Colbert of Kotaku called One Piece a
"masterpiece", highlighting Oda's character writing, world-building and the balance between "fun and
serious subject matter".[182] Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that One Piece is more about the world-building,
adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the "usual shonen battling" from series like Dragon
Ball and Naruto. Bashir concluded: "While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn't
even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it."[183]
EX Media lauds Oda's art for its "crispy" monochrome pictures, "great use of subtle shade changes" on
color pages, "sometimes exquisite" use of angles, and for its consistency.[184] Shaenon K. Garrity, who at
some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's
craft grew steadily. She states that "he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga

format," notes that "interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure," and recommends
"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets".[185] Mania
Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: "One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast
that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama." He praised Oda's artwork as
"imaginative and creative" and commented that "Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [sic]". He
also noted that "Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially
during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast".[186]
In March 2021, Mobile Suit Gundam 's creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that One Piece is
the "only manga to trust". He praised the manga, commenting: "Still, we are working in the same studio
and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know,
among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting
nonetheless. And I don't trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is One Piece.[187]
After the release of the hundredth volume, Weekly Shonen Jump 's editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano,
explained how One Piece changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that Weekly
Shonen Jump is "a game of weekly popularity", and before One Piece, he aimed for something "interesting
this week without thinking about the next"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its
style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other
series. Nakano lauded Oda for his "overwhelming passion, talent and power" and his "unwavering will" to
deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in
"don't fool the reader" and "there is something interesting ahead of it".[188]

Merchandise
The brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[189][190]

Awards and accolades
One Piece was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Award in the shōnen category in 1999.[191] It was
a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002,[192][193][194] with
the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years.[195] The manga was nominated for Favorite
Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards.[196] In 2012, the series won the 41st Japan
Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's Neko Darake.[197] In 2014,
the series received the 18th Yomiuri Advertising Award's Golden Medal.[198] It also won the 34th
Newspaper Advertising Award in the Advertising category[199] and the 67th Advertising Dentsu Award in
Newspaper Advertising Planning category.[200]
The forty-sixth volume of One Piece was the best manga of 2007, according to the Oricon's Japanese Book
of the Year Action Committee.[201] The series was chosen as one of the best continuing manga for all
ages/teens in 2011 by critics from About.com, Anime News Network, and ComicsAlliance.[202] The series
has ranked on the "Book of the Year" list from Media Factory's Da Vinci magazine, where professional
book reviewers, bookstore employees, and Da Vinci readers participate; it ranked fifth in 2011;[203] second
in 2012;[204] third in 2013;[205] second in 2014, 2015 and 2016;[206][207][208] third in 2017 and
2018;[209][210] second in 2019;[211] third in 2020 and 2021;[212][213] second in 2022;[214] and third in
2023.[215] It ranked eighth in the 2023 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list of best manga
for male readers.[216]

The German translation of the manga won the Sondermann Award in the international manga category in
2005. The series received the award for the forty-fourth volume in 2008[217] and the forty-eighth volume in
2009.[218] One Piece won the AnimeLand's Anime & Manga 19th Grand Prix for the "Best Classic
Shōnen" category in 2012.[219][220]
In a poll conducted by Oricon in 2008 about "the most moving (touching) manga ever", One Piece ranked
first in both male and female categories.[221] In another 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it
the most interesting manga.[222] On Tencent's anime and manga web portal, One Piece ranked first in a poll
of "must-read manga for the younger generation in China".[223] In a poll conducted by eBookJapan in
2014 about "manga that children want to read" for "Children's Reading Day" by the Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the series also ranked first.[224]
On June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and One Piece had set the Guinness World Record
for "The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author" with 320,866,000 copies
printed worldwide by December 2014;[225] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over
500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100
million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[130] The series ranked fourth on the first
annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[226] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the
results of its "Manga General Election" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their "Most Favorite
Manga", One Piece ranked first on the list.[227][228]
In 2014, the "One Piece Premiere Summer" event received the "Best Overall Production" award from the
International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[229]

Cultural impact
As part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10
statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture. Luffy was the first statue to be unveiled in front of
the Kumamoto Prefectual Government Office on November 30, 2018. Jinbe was the last statue, unveiled at
Sumiyoshi Kaigan Park on July 23, 2022.[230][231]
At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Greek athlete Miltiadis Tentoglou performed a "Gear Second" pose before
winning a gold medal in the men's long jump competition.[232] A gene in the fruit fly (Drosophila
melanogaster) was named "Baramicin", partly taking inspiration from the One Piece character Buggy. The
gene encodes a protein that is split up into multiple parts.[233] A testate amoeba genus was named Alabasta,
partly in reference to the One Piece Kingdom of Alabasta, also known as the Kingdom of Sand, a desert
kingdom located on Sandy Island in the Paradise region.[234]
